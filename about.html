                    <p class="mb-4">I am a lover of melody, harmony, and words. The songs I connect with the most—and the ones I write—often speak of difficult realities, yet they always hold onto hope for the future. I would describe them as "beautiful, sad, but hopeful," a sentiment that resonates deeply with me.</p>
                    
                    <p class="mb-4">I first picked up the guitar as a high school student in New Jersey, but it wasn't until I moved to Boston in my mid-20s that I began writing my own songs. I'm forever grateful to my friend Brian Jansen, one of my first "teachers" of songwriting, for encouraging me to explore this craft. Another source of inspiration has been my friend Natali Freed, a fellow musician and a member of my former band, Hot Lava Mamas.</p>
                    
                    <p class="mb-4">I am deeply thankful for the incredible production on my first two EPs, brought to life by Doug Kwartler of Hollow Body Studios in Chelmsford, MA. His mastery and guidance have meant so much to me.</p>
                    
                    <p class="mb-4">Now, I live in the Boston area with my husband and our three cats. Singing harmonies is one of my favorite things to do, and I'm always open to lending my contralto vocals to new projects.</p>
